# Project Name

First pair-programming project with Technigo boot camp, and first project using Javascript. We created a chatbot selling flowers. 


## The problem

We struggled with Javascript because none of us had worked with it before. We got help from a code coach and googled. We made the project with a step-by-step approach.
